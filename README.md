# tidy-dagster

`tidy-dagster` is a planning workspace for a staged, standalone reimplementation of TidyCell's spreadsheet-to-recipe pipeline and its future semantic-data and microsimulation-calibration workflow.

## Current status

**Planning only.** No application has been bootstrapped, no Git repository has been initialized, and no provider, recipe-approval, semantic-adoption, calibration, or Sembla execution authority is granted here.

Two architectural decisions were confirmed on 2026-08-09:

1. Build a **staged standalone reimplementation**, proving parity one vertical slice at a time rather than wrapping TidyCell indefinitely or attempting a big-bang rewrite.
2. Use **deliberate polyglot boundaries**:
   - Python owns Dagster orchestration and ML;
   - a standalone TypeScript worker owns workbook, RecipeV01, and evidence-building behavior, and may validate pinned semantic exports without claiming semantic-contract authority;
   - Sembla will remain an external Rust CLI and must be pinned before real use; no version or artifact is selected yet.

Dagster is a replaceable control-plane adapter. It must not become the sole store of evidence, identities, approvals, or business rules.

- [Source evidence and planning baseline](docs/source-evidence.md)
- [ADR 0001 — staged standalone reimplementation](docs/decisions/0001-staged-standalone-reimplementation.md)
- [ADR 0002 — deliberate polyglot boundaries](docs/decisions/0002-deliberate-polyglot-boundaries.md)

## Intended end-to-end path

```text
source inventory
  → immutable workbook bytes
  → worksheet profile
  → recipe candidate
  → deterministic RecipeV01 execution
  → human recipe decision
  → effective approved recipe, when applicable
  → deterministic tidy output
  → separately authorized publication, when applicable
  → semantic tables and cells
  → semantic review and adoption
  → frozen calibration-design ledger
  → Sembla target projection
  → simulation observations and scores
```

The semantic and calibration stages are future gated capabilities. The current justice scaffold remains draft/provisional, calibration-role assignment remains deferred, and the Sembla justice integration is still proposed rather than implemented.

## First implementation target

The first executable milestone should remain provider-free:

```text
frozen simple-crosstab.xlsx
  → standalone TypeScript parsing
  → frozen RecipeV01 validation and execution
  → exact JSON and CSV parity
  → an external fixture harness verifies local content and derivation records
```

Only after that slice is byte-stable should the project add sparse and multi-table fixtures, the Python repository/gateway, a thin Dagster projection, external review decisions, replayed generation, live-provider readiness, semantic contracts, or Sembla integration.

## Permanent guardrails

- Content bytes and explicit contract versions define identity; paths and display names do not.
- Human decisions are attributable immutable records, not inferred from file presence or passing checks.
- Provider responses are saved before interpretation and reused on retry.
- Large artifacts live in content-addressed storage, not Dagster event logs or step payloads.
- Deterministic domain behavior remains runnable and testable without Dagster.
- The new project must not import mutable source code from the TidyCell, justice-scaffold, or Sembla worktrees.
- Research evidence, production approvals, semantic adoption, calibration design, and execution authorization remain separate authorities.
